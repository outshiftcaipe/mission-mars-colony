# Report on the Surface of Mars

## Introduction

Mars, the fourth planet from the Sun, has long fascinated scientists and the public alike due to its dramatic red color and the possibility of life. Modern high-resolution mapping and exploration have provided detailed insights into its surface, geology, and physical characteristics.

## Geological History and Time Periods

Mars's geological history is divided into three primary periods:

- **Noachian Period (4.5–3.5 billion years ago):**  
  Characterized by the formation of the oldest surfaces, heavy impact cratering, and the development of the Tharsis volcanic upland. Extensive flooding by liquid water occurred late in this period.

- **Hesperian Period (3.5–2.9 billion years ago):**  
  Marked by the formation of extensive lava plains.

- **Amazonian Period (2.9 billion years ago–present):**  
  Features fewer meteorite impact craters and varied geology. Olympus Mons, the largest volcano in the solar system, formed during this period.

## Recent Geological Activity

- **Volcanism and Water Flows:**  
  Sheet-like lava flows in Athabasca Valles (~200 million years ago) and water flows in Cerberus Fossae (<20 million years ago) indicate recent volcanic and hydrological activity.

- **Avalanches:**  
  The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has captured images of avalanches, showing ongoing surface changes.

## Physical Characteristics

- **Size and Gravity:**  
  Mars is about half the diameter of Earth, with a surface area slightly less than Earth's dry land. It has 15% of Earth's volume and 11% of its mass, resulting in about 38% of Earth's surface gravity.

- **Surface Appearance:**  
  The red-orange color is due to iron(III) oxide (nanophase Fe₂O₃) and the mineral goethite. Other surface colors include golden, brown, tan, and greenish, depending on mineral content.

## Internal Structure

- **Crust:**  
  Average thickness is 42–56 km, with a minimum of 6 km (Isidis Planitia) and a maximum of 117 km (Tharsis plateau).  
  *Source: [48][49]*

- **Mantle:**  
  Silicate mantle with a rigid lithosphere down to ~250 km. The mantle is heterogenous, with dense fragments from ancient impacts.  
  *Source: [45][56][57]*

- **Core:**  
  Iron and nickel core, partially molten, possibly with a solid inner core (radius ~613 km). The core is enriched in sulfur, oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen.

## Surface Geology

- **Composition:**  
  The surface is primarily tholeiitic basalt, with regions richer in silica (andesitic rocks or glass). Low albedo areas suggest plagioclase feldspar and sheet silicates. Hematite and olivine are also present.  
  *Source: [65][66]*

- **Regolith and Soil:**  
  Covered by fine iron(III) oxide dust. Soil is slightly alkaline (pH 7.7), contains magnesium, sodium, potassium, chlorine, and 0.6% perchlorate (toxic to humans).  
  *Source: [67][68][69][70][71][72]*

- **Surface Features:**  
  Streaks, dust devils, and avalanches are common. Streaks may be caused by avalanches of bright dust or underlying dark soil, with some hypotheses involving water or biological activity.

## Environmental Radiation

- **Radiation Levels:**  
  Average surface radiation is 0.64 millisieverts/day, lower in Hellas Planitia (0.342 millisieverts/day) and potentially as low as 0.064 millisieverts/day in lava tubes.

## Magnetic Characteristics

- **Magnetism:**  
  Mars lacks a global magnetic field but has magnetized crustal regions, indicating past polarity reversals and possible ancient plate tectonic activity.

## Geography and Naming

- **Mapping and Naming:**  
  Mars's features are named from classical mythology, scientists, writers, and towns. Large valleys are named for "Mars" or "star" in various languages.

## Cultural and Scientific Context

- **Speculation and Fiction:**  
  Despite no evidence of habitation, pseudoscientific speculation about intelligent life persists, inspired by features like the "Face on Mars." Mars's dramatic color and early scientific speculation have fueled its depiction in fiction, such as H.G. Wells's *The War of the Worlds* and Ray Bradbury's *The Martian Chronicles*.
